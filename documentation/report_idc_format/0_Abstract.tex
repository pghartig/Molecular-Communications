Estimation of the probability distribution function characterizing a communication channel is investigated. In this work, pilot symbol sequences are used to train a neural network to estimate unknown channel probability distribution functions. The estimated function is then evaluated as a metric for the Viterbi algorithm. In particular, the detection performance is investigated for channels relevant to the molecular communications domain. A proposal is then made to reduce the complexity of the resulting detection scheme using a supervised learning method. The neural network based estimation is tested in simulations and shown for relevant channels.
