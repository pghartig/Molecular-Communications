# Usage Tutorial
This tutorial will walk through an example of using the development framework described in the [introduction](framework.md) to implement a couple of basic components of a communication system.

##Outline
The end goal of this example will be to implement a basic  channel coding scheme and detector for a basic communication channel. The steps will be:

1.  Describe a transmit signal
2.  Encode the transmit signal with the channel coding scheme
3.  Transmit the encoded signal
4.  Perform hard-decision detection on the received signal
5.  Decode the received detected signal using the channel code

##Implement
```shell
testing
```
