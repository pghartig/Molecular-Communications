The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of decoding algorithms which use neural networks in molecular 
communications channels. In particular, this work will focus on incorporating neural networks into the Viterbi algorithm decoding 
framework. As the Viterbi algorithm is ideal when knowledge of the channel model and the current model parameters are known, this will 
provide an environment in which to benchmark the performance of a neural network based approach. Further, for many channels in molecular
communications, models are not available or finding parameters of the model may be difficult. Incorporating neural networks into this
framework allows for models to be created in a data-driven approach.
