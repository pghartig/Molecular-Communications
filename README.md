# Communication System Project
Welcome! This project can thought of as two sub-projects:
1.  [A framework for development and testing of communication system components](/documentation/readmes/framework.md)

2.  [Various component implementations utilizing the above framework](/documentation/readmes/implementations.md)

If you are interested in using the framework to develop system components, please read the [usage tutorial](/documentation/readmes/tutorial.md).
The [table of contents](/documentation/readmes/implementations.md) in the implementations section provides a list and brief description of some of the components implemented up to now.

## Neural Network-Based Equalization
The framework above was developed during the investigation of a neural network-based
equalization scheme for use in the molecular communications domain. For further details regarding this work,
please see the corresponding report found [here](/documentation/report_idc_format/Main_Document.pdf).
